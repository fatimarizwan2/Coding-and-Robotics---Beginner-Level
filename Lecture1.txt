Lecture 1 Part 1:

In this lecture, we will introduce HTML, focusing on creating a basic webpage structure. You will learn about HTML tags, including <!DOCTYPE HTML>, <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <h1>, <p>, and the importance of opening and closing tags. 

Intro to HTML:

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
It describes all the headings, paragraphs and images that make up a website

We have to start by creating a tab. We can do this by typing <!DOCTYPE HTML> 
This lets the web browser know that the page is written in the programming language HTML
the  (less than and greater than)"< and >" symbols are apart of the HTML syntax to define tags.

Start off by telling the browser that this is an HTML document. We can do this by putting in an opening an closing tag <html> and </html>. (most tags must have an opening and closing part)

Next we have the <head> tag. This is where the important things are processed first. The closing tag for this is </head>

The <body> tag is the tag that contains all the website content. This goes after the <head> tag. The closing tag for body is </body>

You can notice a pattern here. Each beginning tag starts with a < and ends with >. We can also see that every ending tag has the same symbols but has a / symbol right after the <. This / tells us that it is an end tag. 

The <title> </title> tag is used to put in a title. All the content must go BETWEEN the opening and closing tags. An example is <title> Introduction to HTML </title>

The <h1> </h1> tag is a header tag. You can write your heading for your paragraph here. There are many different heading tags. We will explore them later. 

The p tag defines a paragraph. <p>This is a paragraph.</p> A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

You should always add comments to your code. This will make it easier for yourself and others to read what you have coded. 

 <!-- This is a comment. my computer will not display this -- >.

 The computer reads whatever is in between this <!-- -- > a sa comment. That means that you can see it, and whoever is reading your code can see it but your computer WILL NOT display it as output. 


Don't forget to save your file! All HTML files must be saved as a .html file (dot h t m l) 

Here is a rough outline of what an HTML document should look like:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html> 
<head>
<title>
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
</h1>
<p>
</p>
</body>
</html>

Activity 2:
Let's create a website!
Topic: introduce yourself
Instructions:
Create a file called Activity2.html
Your website must have a title. For this activity, this should be your full name
Your website must have a heading. For this activity, this should be called “About me”
Your website must have ONE body paragraph. 
Things you can talk about: 
your favourite food
your favourite movie
Your favourite colour
Do you have any pets? What is the pet? What is its name?
End with “I Love Coding!”


My example for this:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html> 
<head>
<title>
Iron Man
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
About me!
</h1>
My name is Iron Man! My favourite colour is green. My favourite movie is Iron Man. I love Pasta! I do not have any pets. I Love Coding!
</body>
</html>

You will notice that the website is very basic. The text is black and the background is white. You can see the title on the top of the tab. 

How to do your assignment:
On the search bar search for Notepad or Notepad++ and use whichever one your computer has downloaded. 


Lecture 1 Part 2:
Building on the previous lecture, this part will introduce additional HTML tags, including <img> for images, <ul> and <li> for unordered lists, <ol> for ordered lists, <b> for bold text, <em> for italic emphasis, <u> for underlining, and <a> for hyperlinks. 

HTML:

Let's continue with the template that we learned about and created in the last lecture:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html> 
<head>
<title>
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
</h1>
</body>
</html>

We will be adding and learning about more tags.

Images
We can add an image to the website. This is done by using the tag <img src=>

This tag means Image Source. Src (source) defines the location of an image. This can be a google link or something saved in your computer. 

We will use an image from the internet. https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kfyk4ne0vb187mhh1o95.jpg

The way we would format this is: 
<img src=https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kfyk4ne0vb187mhh1o95.jpg>

We can insert this anywhere between our body tags. 

Lists:
To create a list, we can use the <ul> and <li> tags: UL stands for Unordered list and li stand for list. You can add as many <li> tags between the <ul> </ul> tags. 
The format goes:
	<ul>
		<li> </li>
		<li> </li>
		<li> </li>
	</ul>
The <ol> tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical.
	<ol>
		<li> </li>
		<li> </li>
		<li> </li>
	</ol>
We can make a list start at any number we want using start= inside out ol tag: <ol start="10">

Two different ordered lists (the first list starts at 1, and the second starts at 10):

<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

<ol start="10">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

Typographical emphasis:
When adding typographical emphasis to a word, sentence or paragraph, the part you want the emphasis on MUST be BETWEEN the tags. 

We can make a word or sentence bold by simply adding in the bold tag. <b> </b>
We can add italic emphasis to a word by adding in the em tag <em> </em>
We can underline text using the underline tag. <u> </u>

The anchor tag: <a> </a>. It defines a hyperlink. A hyperlink we used to link one page to another. The anchor tag comes with the href=“” attribute. This specifies the URL of the page the link goes to when clicked on. The link we will look at is: https://uregina.ca/~frf706/ 

If we want the link to open in a new tab instead of the same one we would need to put in a target. Target specifies where the page will open. 
<p>Visit my website: <a href="https://uregina.ca/~frf706/" target="_blank">https://uregina.ca/~frf706/</a></p>
this means that my link will be opened up in a new tab.

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html> 
<head>
<title>
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
</h1>
<img src=>
		<ul>

In this lesson, you learned how to build a simple webpage using a coding language called HTML. We talked about different HTML tags, which are like special commands.
You learned about tags like <!DOCTYPE HTML>, <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <h1>, and <p>. These are like building blocks that help you create different parts of a webpage, such as titles, paragraphs, and headings.
We even had a little quiz to check if you remembered the important things, like how to use tags and what HTML is for.
In the next part, we added more cool things! We talked about adding pictures with <img>, making lists with <ul> and <ol>, and making text bold <b>, italic <em>, and underlined <u>. We also learned about making links with <a> and how to make them open in a new tab.
So, now you know how to make a simple webpage and make it look even cooler with pictures, lists, and special text. Great job!
In the next lesson, we will explore the fascinating world of HTML styling and formatting, taking our coding skills to the next level! We’re going to build on what we've learned so far, and discover how to make our web pages look even cooler by adding colours, changing fonts, and experimenting with different text styles. We'll introduce advanced techniques like defining smaller text with the `<small>` element, marking or highlighting text with `<mark>`, and even including deleted or inserted text using `<del>` and `<ins>`. We will also explore subscript and superscript text with `<sub>` and `<sup>`. You'll also learn how to quote and cite with `<blockquote>` and `<q>`.
